This article is more how to whip up a PM sensor using easily found components than actual health based knowledge beyond some sort of cursory why should I care. I would defer to my substack at <https://jesseandersonresearch.substack.com/> which will end up as <https://research.jesse-anderson.net/> as soon as I decide I want to give Substack \$50 to change the routing(eventually?) for anything health related. However, what's the point in knowing how to build something if you don't know why you're building it? For that we can do a basic primer as you'll see below:\

### Why Particulate Matter (PM) Deserves Attention

### What it is

-   **PM10** - particles up to 10 µm, mostly from mechanical processes such as road dust and construction.

-   **PM2.5** - particles up to 2.5 µm, dominated by combustion sources like vehicles, wildfires and power plants.

-   **PM1** - particles up to 1 µm, often secondary aerosols or diesel and wood smoke; they can cross the alveolar membrane, enter the bloodstream and drive systemic inflammation.

### Why it is harmful

-   A recent meta-analysis reported an **11 percent rise in cardiovascular mortality for every 10 µg** m⁻³ **long-term increase in PM2.5** exposure \[6\].

-   **PM2.5 now contributes to about 8.1 million premature deaths each year worldwide** - 58 percent from ambient PM2.5 and 38 percent from household air pollution \[3\]. The report mentioned in the reference is actually really good, with lots of visuals and a pretty easy read!

-   Toxic metals, black carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adsorb onto particulates, adding carcinogenic and oxidative-stress burdens.

-   PM1 is theorized by \[13\] to cause 13.1% and 15.3% elevated risk of overall and essential hypertension hospitalization respectively.

I generally just use the WHO values as a basis, but I'm including the US values as a comparison. Unless stated otherwise I'm taking the ideal values where they exist, if the values correspond to an unhealthy for sensitive groups, etc it will be shown in brackets.

To dive a bit more into the whole sulfur issue and monitoring lacking(a bunch of missed days...).. The inadequacy of sulfur monitoring becomes starkly apparent during environmental disasters, as demonstrated by a 2022 study of Beaumont, Texas - a city surrounded by major petroleum refineries. When Hurricane Harvey struck in August 2017, the community's already limited air monitoring network essentially went dark at the worst possible time. With only two monitors covering the entire industrial city, officials shut down equipment for a full week (August 25-September 1) to prevent storm damage, leaving residents without any data on air quality while refineries were in operation. The hydrogen sulfide monitor was particularly unreliable, missing 213 days of data in 2017 alone, with overall data capture rates plummeting to just 39% during the hurricane period. Even when operational, the monitor consistently recorded hydrogen sulfide concentrations above OSHA safety limits at levels residents could smell daily. This case illustrates how monitoring gaps compound during crises: precisely when industrial accidents and emergency shutdowns release the most pollution, communities lose the data needed to assess health risks\[18\].

As an aside, OSHA considers Sulfur Dioxide 5ppm or 13 mg m⁻³ to be permissible exposure limit, 10 hr time weighted average 2 ppm for their recommended exposure limit\[20\]. The values seen above according to the data in the journal article show an average of 0.68ppb in 2017 and an H2S RfC of 1.0 ppb for the general population\[21\]. This is in contrast to the 0.14ppb value that is cited in the journal. Overall, with the missing sensor days, dated EPA guidelines, and general confusion in interpreting these values it becomes even more critically important to monitor one's environments for particulate and chemical matter.

**Why include these gases in a DIY station?**\
Electrochemical and MOS chips are inexpensive and socket-friendly but drift over months – especially SO2 and O3 cells that consume electrolyte. A modular stack lets you swap a single daughter-board instead of rebuilding the whole monitor, keeps recalibration simple and preserves the data stream. Also note that ionizers and some photocatalytic filters generate ozone as a by-product, so having an O3 channel is prudent. Its pretty cheap to get the boards direct off aliexpress and swap every now and then(the electrochemical ones you can also set to turn on once an hour or so which will greatly prolong life!).

## Indoor versus outdoor – the hidden peaks

-   **Baseline indoor air** in modern low-emission US homes averages 3–4 µg m⁻³ PM2.5 – roughly half of local outdoor levels \[4\]. Note that this was a Texas study; I generally get 0/0/0 PM 1/2.5/10 indoors, but I have air purifiers running. 4th of July, Wildfires, and cooking smoke can spike values! I will give the data later on in this article.

-   **Cooking on a gas hob(stove, range)** can drive indoor PM2.5 above 100 µg m⁻³, with peaks near 650 µg m⁻³ recorded in UK field tests \[5\]. Even closed windows may not clear those peaks for hours.

-   **Wildfire smoke** regularly pushes outdoor daily means above 100 µg m⁻³\[22\]; infiltration often delivers 33-76 percent of that burden indoors\[23\]. Note that the use of a HEPA based portable air cleaner in the second study lead to a reduction of PM2.5 levels during the wildfire by 48-78% with windows closed. Considering that you're getting 33-76% smoke infiltration that's significant!

-   Another notable aspect of \[23\] is testing a DIY Lasko box fan and MERV 13 filter(see Appendix/Supplements). This provided a \~59%(+/-25%SD) effectiveness in reducing indoor PM2.5 levels during wildfire episodes. For \~\$30-\$50 having a few of these on hand could prove useful. I personally have a bunch of box fans and would just need to go grab some filters.

## Why monitor PM yourself

-   **Regulatory gaps** - government stations provide perhaps one reading per county; your micro-environment can differ wildly near traffic, grills or printers.

-   **Short events** - cooking, candles and yard burns create hour-scale spikes invisible in 24-h averages.

-   **Personal health optimisation** - live data lets asthmatics, COPD patients and athletes ventilate or mask up before symptoms hit.

-   **Community science and advocacy** - crowd-sourced maps have triggered filter giveaways and “clean-air room” programs during wildfire crises.

## Targets when deploying a sensor build

-   **Indoor annual goal** - keep PM2.5 below 5 µg m⁻³ and PM1 below 2 µg m⁻³.

-   **Ventilation trigger** - alarm or start fans if indoor PM2.5 \> 15 µg m⁻³ or PM1 \> 10 µg m⁻³ for more than 15 min.

-   **Outdoor module siting** - breathing height, at least 2 m from walls and clear of exhaust vents. Refer to sensor documentation for additional details!
