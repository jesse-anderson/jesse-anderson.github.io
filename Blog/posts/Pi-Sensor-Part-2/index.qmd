After finally getting everything to work on the [database side of things](https://jesse-anderson.github.io/Blog/_site/posts/Pi-Sensor-Proj-May-2024/) I wanted to explore dashboarding and being able to quickly pull up a visual showing what the current values are for the sensor data. After spending a few hours with Grafana and discovering that it doesn't play nicely enough with JSON for my tastes(but pretty nicely with SQL type DBs...) I decided to just code up a pretty simple dashboard which shows the last four or so odd hours of sensor data. Its fairly simple using Chart.js and pulling the JSON data from ThingSpeak(last 6,000 entries \@ 2s avg sampling = 200 min = 3 hours 20 min). I'm currently "pressure testing" the raspberry pi 4 I have and trying to ensure I have at least a week of uptime before I move to an ESP32 based solution which should let me get the rate of sampling up. The visual is below and I'll explain the code afterwards:

Breaking down the code:

<details>

<summary>Code Summary</summary>

1.  **Fetch Data**:

    -   **`fetchData()`**: Fetches the last 6,000 entries from the ThingSpeak API. The **`await`** keyword ensures the function waits for the data to be fetched before moving on.

2.  **Process Data**:

    -   **`processData(feeds)`**: Processes the raw data to extract timestamps, temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit, and humidity. It returns these as arrays.

3.  **Display Latest Values**:

    -   **`displayLatestValues(labels, tempC, tempF, humidity)`**: Extracts the latest values from the arrays and formats them into an HTML table. The **`toLocaleDateString`** and **`toLocaleTimeString`** methods format the date and time in MM/DD/YYYY and 12-hour format respectively.

4.  **Create Chart**:

    -   **`createChart()`**: Fetches and processes the data, then uses Chart.js to create a line chart with three datasets: Temperature C, Temperature F, and Humidity. It configures the x-axis to display time and the y-axis to start at zero. It also calls **`displayLatestValues`** to update the latest values table.

5.  **Refresh Data**:

    -   **`refreshData()`**: Destroys the existing chart instance and creates a new one with the latest data.

6.  **Window Onload**:

    -   **`window.onload`**: Ensures the chart is created when the page loads.

By breaking down the code into these sections, we can see how each part works together to fetch data, process it, display it in a chart, and show the latest values in a table. This simple dashboard provides a visual representation of sensor data over the last few hours, making it easier to monitor and analyze the data in real time.

Overall, this is a lot more lightweight than Grafana and given the fact that I'm not generating large amounts of traffic to Thingspeak this works very well as a simple logger/check-in for myself. I'm sure there's a lot more convoluted ways of checking on the sensors, but this web interface allows me to quickly assess if I have downtime or the sensors are toast.

Additionally, I downloaded RaspController on iOS to quickly check on my sensors when at home. Overall, the ads were a bit intrusive and even reading from the simple DHT11 sensor was a bit goofy with the sensor readout being read then a few seconds later the readings disconnecting. I believe there's a PRO version, but I doubt the functionality boost warrants the price as the web display is robust enough.

Regardless I plan on implementing an ESP32 based solution moving forward. Some comparisons are noted below based on what I've read online, but of course that can change once experience/pain sets in. I'm assuming that the 2s delay I'm experiencing will get worse as I add more sensors so I'm assuming the worst. I also plan on implementing the sensors outlined in my [first raspberry pi post](https://jesse-anderson.github.io/Blog/_site/posts/Pi-Sensor-Proj-May-2024/).

#### **Overview of Sensors**

1.  **PMS5003**: Measures particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) with a typical update interval of 1 second.

2.  **MH-Z19**: Measures CO2 levels with an update interval of every 2-3 seconds.

3.  **DHT22**: Measures temperature and humidity with a sampling rate of 2 seconds.

4.  **BME680**: Measures temperature, humidity, pressure, and VOC, with data output intervals ranging from 1 to 3 seconds.

5.  **MQ135**: Measures air quality (VOC levels), requires analog-to-digital conversion and calibration for accurate readings.

#### **1. Sampling Speed and Sensor Handling**

-   **Raspberry Pi**:

    -   **Capabilities**: Equipped with a multi-core CPU and up to 8GB RAM, allowing concurrent handling of multiple sensors.

    -   **PMS5003**: Capable of continuous 1-second updates.

    -   **MH-Z19**: Efficiently handles 2-3 second intervals.

    -   **DHT22**: Manages 2-second intervals smoothly.

    -   **BME680**: Processes complex outputs (temperature, humidity, pressure, VOC) every 1-3 seconds.

    -   **MQ135**: Utilizes an ADC for continuous data reading.

    -   **Overall Sampling**: Can read from all sensors simultaneously, processing and displaying data in real-time.

-   **ESP32**:

    -   **Capabilities**: Dual-core processor designed for real-time processing, but might need optimization for simultaneous high-frequency data handling(C++).

    -   **PMS5003**: Handles 1 Hz output effectively.

    -   **MH-Z19**: Manages 2-3 second intervals efficiently.

    -   **DHT22**: Handles 2-second intervals without issues.

    -   **BME680**: Efficiently processes complex outputs within the 1-3 second range.

    -   **MQ135**: Uses built-in ADC for continuous data but might have fewer channels than an external ADC.

    -   **Overall Sampling**: Can handle the cumulative sampling rate with careful resource management.

#### **2. Overhead from Operating System**

-   **Raspberry Pi**:

    -   **OS**: Runs a full Linux-based OS (e.g., Raspbian) with a graphical user interface, background processes, and system services.

The ESP32, with its low cost, low power consumption, and efficient real-time processing capabilities, is ideal for simpler, cost-effective, and portable sensor applications. Additionally, the cost of failure for a raspberry pi is quite large while an ESP32 is negligible. I would like to have a real time setup along with a dynamic plot of temp, humidity, etc. for a plant monitoring project. To do this at scale(someone has 50+ plants....) I need to dramatically reduce cost. Additionally, I need to also begin budgeting for a Pi cluster project to learn distributed/parallel computing, which, funny enough, are two classes in my Master's at UIUC that I would like to take(CS425 and CS484 respectively). Truth be told much of this IoT Raspberry Pi/Arduino type work recently stems from a desire to take the IoT class at UIUC, but that class' priority relative to other courses such as Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, etc. is dead last and puts me over the credits I need. Additionally, implementing X/Y/Z with this hardware allows me to learn how things work at a fraction of tuition(1/10).

Ideally the cluster would serve as a way of actually learning parallel computing and also establishing some local web services to make my life easier. The tentative list of local web service projects include:

1.  [**Plant Monitoring Dashboard**]{.underline}

    -   **Project:** A centralized dashboard to monitor temp, humidity, soil moisture, and other environmental factors for plants of concern.

    -   **Tech:** I plan on using Flask/Django for the backend, React for the frontend, and a database like PostgreSQL for the DB.

    -   **Benefits:** I also plan on implementing some sort of algorithm to determine when there's a problem and sending push notifications or texts to the user.

2.  [**Personal Cloud Storage**]{.underline}

    -   Self hosted cloud storage solution using something like NextCloud to store and share files securely. I might keep this guy local though as the only thing I plan on exposing to the World Wide Web would be a website which uses Cloudflare for security.

3.  [**Local Development Server(Local Git)**]{.underline}

    -   **Project:** Development environment for testing and deploying web applications and other software projects.

    -   **Tech:** I'd likely use Docker for containerized environments, Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines, and Git for version control. I would also deeply expand my knowledge of what's what with this tech.

    -   **Benefits:** This should actually help standardize and streamline my development workflow, let me perform automated testing/deployment, and provide a stable/cheap platform for experimentation with new tech.

4.  [**Media Server(Mostly PS4/Samsung TV)**]{.underline}

    -   **Project:** Local media server to host/stream media content like movies/music/photos

    2.  **Technology:** Mosquitto for MQTT communication, InfluxDB for time-series data, and Grafana(if I'm not using JSON's...) for visualization.

    3.  **Benefits:** Centralized control and visualization of all IoT devices, real time monitoring, and simplified firmware updates. I will have to write quite a bit of C++ code now that I think about it to ensure the ESP32 works and works fast.

6.  [**Network Monitoring Tool**]{.underline}

    1.  **Project:** Basic system to monitor the health/performance of my network.

    2.  **Tech:** Raspberry Pi for running the software.

    3.  **Benefits:** Ad blocking, boost privacy, reduce data usage, reduce DNS query times and overall help speed up my network.

8.  [**HPC Pi**]{.underline}

    1.  **Project:** Build a scalable Raspberry Pi cluster(at least 3) to learn and implement parallel computing, distributed computing, and high performance computing concepts.

    2.  **Tech:** Multiple raspberry pis, networking equipment, cluster management software, and parallel computing libraries(OpenMP/MPI). Plus Kubernetes.

    3.  **Benefits:** Hands on experience with distributed systems and parallel processing, cost effective way of exploring high performance computing, and gaining marketable skills in cluster setup, management, and scalability.

Tentatively something like [this tutorial ](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/cluster-raspberry-pi-tutorial/)will be followed and result in a three pi setup vs the 8 pi setup below(from the tutorial):
