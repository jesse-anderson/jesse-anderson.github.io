I launched this blog in April of 2024 as part of a unique project aimed at creating a space for my thoughts and analyses, free from the constraints and subscriptions of platforms like Medium, and distinct from the algorithm-driven feeds of LinkedIn. While there's certainly more content on the way, I hope this introduction serves as a more engaging placeholder than a simple "This is my blog."
