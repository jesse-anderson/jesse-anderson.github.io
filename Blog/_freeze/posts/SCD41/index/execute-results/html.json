It uses a photoacoustic NDIR sensing principle along with Sensirion's patented technology to offer high accuracy at a competitive price. I personally picked up this sensor for \\$28.99, and it could likely be found at a lower price directly from the manufacturer or via platforms like AliExpress. The sensor also includes on-chip signal compensation with a built-in SHT4x humidity and temperature sensor to account for fluctuations in environmental conditions, ensuring accurate CO2 readings.\n\n### Technical Performance\n\n**Generalized CO2 Accuracy Specification:**\n\n-   **400-1,000 ppm:** ±(50 ppm + 2.5% of reading)\n\n-   **1,001-2,000 ppm:** ±(50 ppm + 3% of reading)\n\n-   **2,001-5,000 ppm:** ±(40 ppm + 5% of reading)\n\n#### Temperature and Humidity Specifications:\n\n-   **Temperature Accuracy**: -10°C to 60°C range with an accuracy of ±0.8°C\n\n-   **Humidity Accuracy**: 0-95% RH range with an accuracy of ±6% RH\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>More Detailed Specifications...</summary>\n\n```         \nSCD41 Sensor Series Specifications\n```\n\n+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n| ```                                 | ```                             | ```                             |\n| Specification                       | Value                           | Unit                            |\n| ```                                 | ```                             | ```                             |\n+=====================================+=================================+=================================+\n| ```                                 | ```                             | ```                             |\n| CO₂ Measurement Range               | 0 -

Using the longest response time as a basis for our sampling, we get a sampling rate of once every 2 minutes. The sensor's extensive command set, clearly detailed in the datasheet, simplifies programming but requires familiarity with numerous commands.\n\nBefore diving into the fundamentals let's visit why we even care about CO2 to begin with.\n\n### CO2 Levels in an Enclosed Space\n\nCO2 levels increase in an enclosed room predictably with time as it is an enclosed system with n number of producers(people). We can actually do a mass balance around the system if we really wanted to to evaluate the amount of CO2 if we had values per person. A mass balance for CO2 in an enclosed room involves calculating how the amount of CO2 changes over time. Since the room is sealed, we start with an initial amount of CO2 and add the CO2 produced by people inside the room. By knowing how much CO2 each person produces per minute, we can estimate the total CO2 in the room after a certain period. This helps us predict how CO2 levels will rise as people continue to breathe, ensuring the air quality is monitored and maintained.\n\nAs CO2 levels increase a number of health complaints can arise and these health complaints are CO2 concentration dependent. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services outline a ppm to health complaint table:\n\n-   **400 ppm:** average outdoor air level.\n\n-   **400–1,000 ppm:** typical level found in occupied spaces with good air exchange.\n\n-   **1,000–2,000 ppm:** level associated with complaints of drowsiness and poor air.\n\n-   **2,000–5,000 ppm:** level associated with headaches, sleepiness, and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be present.\n\n-   **5,000 ppm:** this indicates unusual air conditions where high levels of other gases could also be present. Toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur. This is the permissible exposure limit for daily workplace exposures.\n\n-   **40,000 ppm:** this level is immediately harmful due to oxygen deprivation.\n\nWe also see plenty of examples of CO2 levels reaching dangerous levels in enclosed spaces and I am including images along with associated posts:\n\nFrom <https://vair-monitor.com/>:\n\n![](V_Air_Monitor.png)\n\nFrom [https://cambridgecarbonfootprint.org/](https://cambridgecarbonfootprint.org/what-we-do/carbon-dioxide-monitoring/):\n\n![](Cambridge_CO2.png)\n\nNow if we move to a more engineering based analysis we go to <https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pollution-concentration-rooms-d_692.html> and find that the carbon dioxide concentration in a room is a function of:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<h1>CO2 Concentration Calculation</h1>\n    <p>The carbon dioxide concentration in a room filled with persons after a time \\( t \\) can be calculated as:</p>\n    <pre>\nc = (q / (n V)) [1 - (1 / e<sup>n t</sup>)] + (c<sub>0</sub> - c<sub>i</sub>) (1 / e<sup>n t</sup>) + c<sub>i</sub>                              \n    </pre>\n    <p>where:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>c</b> = carbon dioxide concentration in the room (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>\n        <li><b>q</b> = carbon dioxide supplied to the room (m<sup>3</sup>/h)</li>\n        <li><b>V</b> = volume of the room (m<sup>3</sup>)</li>\n        <li><b>e</b> = the constant 2.718...</li>\n        <li><b>n</b> = number of air shifts per hour (1/h)</li>\n        <li><b>t</b> = time (hour, h)</li>\n        <li><b>c<sub>i</sub></b> = carbon dioxide concentration in the inlet ventilation air (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>\n        <li><b>c<sub>0</sub></b> = carbon dioxide concentration in the room at start, \\( t=0 \\) (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>\n    </ul>\n```\n\nCalculator(the same formula as Engineering Toolbox): Defaults: 2 people, 10ft by 10ft room with 10ft feet ceilings, 1 air change per hour, and the makeup air is the standard 400ppm CO2. This is of course assuming absolutely no gaps and you're truly enclosed. Worst case scenario and as this is not cited anywhere take with a grain of salt!\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>CO2 Concentration Calculator</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 20px;\n        }\n        form {\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n        label {\n            display: block;\n            margin-top: 10px;\n        }\n        input {\n            margin-top: 5px;\n        }\n        button {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>CO2 Concentration Calculator</h1>\n    <form id=\"co2-form\">\n        <label for=\"q\">q - Carbon dioxide supplied to the room per person (m<sup>3</sup>/h person):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"q\" name=\"q\" value=\"0.05\" step=\"0.01\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"persons\">Number of persons in the room:</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"persons\" name=\"persons\" value=\"2\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"V\">V - Volume of the room (m<sup>3</sup>):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"V\" name=\"V\" value=\"28.3168\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"n\">n - Number of air shifts per hour (1/h):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"n\" name=\"n\" value=\"0.125\" step=\"0.01\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"t\">t - Time (hour, h):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"t\" name=\"t\" value=\"8\" step=\"0.1\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"ci\">ci - Carbon dioxide concentration in the make up air (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"ci\" name=\"ci\" value=\"0.0004\" step=\"0.0001\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"c0\">c0 - Carbon dioxide concentration in the room at start, t=0 (m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"c0\" name=\"c0\" value=\"0.000\" step=\"0.0001\" required><br><br>\n\n        <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"calculateCO2()\">Calculate</button>\n    </form>\n\n    <h2>CO2 concentration: <span id=\"result\">0.00657 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> (6574 ppm)</span></h2>\n\n    <script>\n        function calculateCO2() {\n            const q = parseFloat(document.getElementById('q').value);\n            const persons = parseFloat(document.getElementById('persons').value);\n            const V = parseFloat(document.getElementById('V').value);\n            const n = parseFloat(document.getElementById('n').value);\n            const t = parseFloat(document.getElementById('t').value);\n            const ci = parseFloat(document.getElementById('ci').value);\n            const c0 = parseFloat(document.getElementById('c0').value);\n            const e = Math.E;\n\n            const q_total = q * persons;\n            const part1 = (q_total / (n * V)) * (1 - (1 / Math.pow(e, n * t)));\n            const part2 = (c0 - ci) * (1 / Math.pow(e, n * t));\n            const c = part1 + part2 + ci;\n\n            const result = document.getElementById('result');\n            result.innerHTML = `${c.toFixed(5)} m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> (${(c * 1000000).toFixed(0)} ppm)`;\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe also have a similar calculator here: <https://www.soletairpower.fi/co2-calculator/>\n\nFor a more scientifically based study one can navigate to the following: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7411428/>\n\nThe study gives a CO2 based occupancy estimation by correlating the levels of CO2 with the number of occupants in a room with the ultimate goal of reducing energy use by dynamically adjusting HVAC systems in real time. This means you don't ventilate rooms that are unoccupied or ventilate less if they are under-occupied. Its probably possible to tease out a solid mathematical formula that could be put into a calculator, but that is time away from the goal of this article SCD41 and CO2 measurement.\n\n### Characteristics of NDIR Sensors\n\nNDIR sensors measure CO2 by exploiting its property to absorb IR light at around 4.2 µm. They use a non-dispersive band-pass filter to allow only the relevant IR wavelengths to pass, hence the name Non-Dispersive Infrared. An image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor) below outlines various gases and their Mid-infrared absorption spectra:\n\n![](Mid-infrared_absorption_spectra_of_Gases.png)\n\n### How does Photoacoustic NDIR Work?\n\nPhotoacoustic Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) technology is an advanced method used in sensors like the SCD41 to measure gas concentrations, such as CO2, using light and sound. Here’s a brief explanation of how it works:\n\n### Key Steps in Photoacoustic NDIR\n\n1.  **Infrared Light Source**: An infrared (IR) light source emits light at wavelengths absorbed by CO2.\n\n2.  **Gas Absorption**: CO2 molecules absorb this light, causing them to heat up and vibrate.\n\n3.  **Pressure Waves**: The vibrations create tiny sound waves.\n\n4.  **Microphone Detection**: A microphone detects these pressure waves.\n\n5.  **Signal Processing**: The sensor converts these waves into electrical signals to determine CO2 concentration.\n\n6.  **Output**: The final CO2 concentration is displayed for monitoring or further processing.\n\nThis method offers high sensitivity and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time CO2 monitoring in various applications, including indoor air quality and industrial processes. The SCD41 sensor is compact, low-power, and cost-effective, ideal for integration into diverse systems.\n\n### Transmissive NDIR\n\nThese sensors feature an IR emitter and an optical detector at opposite ends of an optical cavity. Here's a quick rundown of how they work:\n\n1.  **IR Emitter**: Emits light through the gas sample.\n\n2.  **Absorption by CO2**: CO2 absorbs specific wavelengths of the IR light.\n\n3.  **Detection**: The detector measures the transmitted IR light.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: CO2 concentration is calculated based on the difference in emitted and transmitted light.\n\nTransmissive NDIR sensors require precise positioning and minimal optical path length to ensure accurate readings.\n\n### TVOC Sensors and eCO2 Readings\n\nUsing Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) sensors, such as the Sensirion SGP30, to estimate CO2 levels is generally unreliable. TVOC sensors measure the concentration of various organic compounds in the air, which can include emissions from household products, cooking, cleaning agents, and even human breath. While these sensors are adept at detecting a wide range of VOCs, they are not designed to specifically measure CO2.\n\n#### Why TVOC Sensors Fall Short for CO2 Estimation\n\n-   **Broad Detection Spectrum**: TVOC sensors detect a broad range of organic compounds, not just CO2. This means they can be influenced by numerous sources of VOCs that are unrelated to CO2 levels, such as air fresheners, deodorizers, and various chemical products used indoors.\n\n-   **Lack of Specificity**: TVOC sensors lack the specificity required to accurately distinguish between CO2 and other VOCs. The presence of other VOCs can cause the sensor to give false indications of high CO2 levels.\n\n-   **Environmental Factors**: Various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of other gases can affect the readings of TVOC sensors, further complicating their accuracy when estimating CO2 levels.\n\nDespite these limitations, some vendors and manufacturers still promote TVOC sensors for CO2 estimation. This can be misleading for consumers who may believe they are getting accurate CO2 measurements. It is important for users to understand these limitations and consider more reliable methods, such as NDIR or photoacoustic sensors, for precise CO2 monitoring.\n\n#### Recommended Use of TVOC Sensors\n\nWhile TVOC sensors are not suitable for accurate CO2 measurement, they are valuable tools for:\n\n-   **Indoor Air Quality Monitoring**: Detecting the presence of harmful VOCs and identifying sources of indoor air pollution.\n\n-   **Health and Safety**: Ensuring that indoor environments are free from harmful concentrations of volatile organic compounds.\n\n-   **Industrial Applications**: Monitoring air quality in industrial settings to ensure compliance with safety regulations.\n\n### Comparing Low-Cost CO2 Sensors\n\n#### NDIR Sensors\n\nNDIR sensors measure CO2 based on gas absorption of IR light. They typically feature an IR emitter, dual channels for reference and measurement, and calculate CO2 concentration by comparing light absorption in these channels.\n\n#### Photo-Acoustic Sensors\n\nPhoto-acoustic sensors also measure absorption but use a microphone to detect the resulting pressure waves. They are smaller and do not rely on line-of-sight, making them suitable for compact applications.\n\nIn the image below we can see a comparison of the photoacoustic and transmissive NDIR sensors:\n\n![](NDIR_Comparison.png)\n\nWorking Principle References:\n\n<https://www.airgradient.com/blog/co2-sensors-photo-acoustic-vs-ndir/>\n\n<https://www.sensirion.com/resource/application_note/ndir-sensors-types>\n\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248969/>\n\n### Setting up the Circuit\n\nThe circuit used here is fairly simple as the SCD41 has 4 inputs.\n\n-   GROUND = GND\n\n-   Voltage_in = VDD\n\n-   SCL = Serial Clock Line\n\n-   SDA = Serial Data Line\n\n![](CircuitSetup_bb.jpg)\n\nThe MicroPython library used is below.

dive into the datasheet and the code for some cursed reason you should be fine with the code above. I was able to log readings fairly close to the reported values for my town and breathing on the device and near the device increased the sensor readings reliably. I did note that the sensor took some time to get back down to baseline and took a bit to get up to the max with me breathing on it. It was roughly 2.5 minutes to get back down to baseline and that's roughly in line with what we would ideally sample at due to the humidity sampling interval mentioned in the technical specs above. See image below:\n\n![](CO2_Values.png)\n\n### Limitations of the SCD41\n\nAs mentioned above we will have a slight delay in logging values so the results won't be instantaneous. Additionally as mentioned by: <https://github.com/octaprog7/SCD4x> one will notice an increase in temperature reading from the sensor if the interval is less than 15 seconds as the sensor will self heat. Additionally, both the SCD40/41 sensors have an auto-calibrate mode which will take the lowest CO2 value from the past 7 days and assumes it is 400ppm. This can cause sensor drift over time unless one regularly(once a week) exposes the sensor to fresh air. It is possible to turn off this auto-calibration mode and one will note that in the code above\\[set_auto_calibration\\]. An anecdote from [User Anx2K on the r/ESP32 Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/12y0x5k/warning_about_the_sensirion_scd4041_co2_sensors/) mentions that there is roughly a 40ppm(10%) drift year to year if one turns off auto calibration. Calibration takes 5 minutes, but is an inherently manual process. It would be nice to be somewhere near a weather monitoring station and set up this CO2 monitor alongside a MH-Z19B/C and MH-Z1+ which use NDIR and compare the initial and end of 24 hour values and assess drift.\n\n### Applications of the SCD41\n\nI am particularly interested in environmental monitoring to assess indoor air quality at a competitive price, allowing users to swap sensors in and out as needed. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to different monitoring requirements without significant additional costs.\n\nAdditionally, monitoring transient dump flows from businesses during off-hours (midnight to 3 AM) is vital. This involves tracking the release of CO2 and other gaseous components using the MQ-\\* sensor series. While this approach may not provide quantitative measurements due to various confounding factors, it serves as an initial assessment tool. This preliminary analysis can justify the purchase or lease of more advanced testing equipment, costing under \\$100 in upfront expenses and requiring only a few hours of labor.\n\nAnother intriguing experiment involves mapping a town with sensors placed every few blocks to monitor localized CO2 concentrations. This data can be correlated with consumer, commercial, and industrial activities, providing valuable insights into the town's environmental impact.\n\nOther applications include monitoring the respiratory activity of plants by measuring CO2 exchange in greenhouse or agricultural research settings. This can offer insights into plant health, photosynthetic efficiency, and growth patterns. Pairing this with R/G/B, UV, and light sensors can help determine several growth parameters. Note that NPK (Nitrogen/Phosphorous/Potassium) sensors are often unreliable based on my research. Therefore, it's better to use actual chemical testing methods or automate the chemical testing apparatus rather than relying on electronic sensors for these measurements.\n\nIn biotechnology and biochemical engineering contexts, monitoring CO2 levels in cellular cultures and bioreactors is essential. Maintaining precise CO2 concentrations ensures the optimal growth of microorganisms, which can significantly reduce production costs. This is particularly important for the pharmaceutical industry, biofuel production, and other bio-based manufacturing processes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SCD41 sensor offers a versatile and accurate solution for CO2 monitoring in various applications. For our particular application, provided we either calibrate it once at the beginning then once more every year we can enjoy accurate CO2 monitoring at a low price.\n\n",
